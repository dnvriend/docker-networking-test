# docker-networking-test
A small project to understand docker networking that has been added in [Docker v1.9](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#190-2015-11-03)

# Networking vs links
When we used links previously using docker, the only option to link containers together was to use links, but it has 
the following shortcomings:

1. Disrupting the link when a container is stopped, started or restarted,
2. Unable to link containers together across different hosts,
3. No need to use the 'ambassador' pattern to link containers together.

Let's get started.

# Single host networking example
When you have installed `docker v1.9`, for example using [brew](http://brew.sh/) you can get started right away using 
the new `docker-networking` feature with the new `docker network` command.

Let's create a new network `linux` with the command:

```bash
$ docker network create linux
```

This command creates a new network called `linux`. Let's inspect the network:

```bash
$ docker network inspect linux
[
    {
        "Name": "linux",
        "Id": "ca11e2f032bfbb262efc0ef9c759d8a6b13c02cdfd225d09b85e9d7e7ab64c9f",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Config": [
                {}
            ]
        },
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {}
    }
]
```

We can see it uses the `bridge` strategy and no `containers` are part of that network. Let's fix that. We will launch two 
ubuntu containers and make them part of the `linux` network:

```bash
$ docker run -it --net=linux --name=ubuntu1 ubuntu
$ docker run -it --net=linux --name=ubuntu2 ubuntu
```

We have two running containers, let's inspect the network now:

```bash
$ docker network inspect linux
[
    {
        "Name": "linux",
        "Id": "ca11e2f032bfbb262efc0ef9c759d8a6b13c02cdfd225d09b85e9d7e7ab64c9f",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Config": [
                {}
            ]
        },
        "Containers": {
            "87e89c70a74628585316ca99bc13d412dac2f24c892bfd376dcac89b0a27d429": {
                "EndpointID": "02e1297e65db1db80b275df53ebccb3871eb0fc1aff6ee5443b3bda843a07636",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            },
            "e388fa26947f9e0422b568a5fa649907b089ad7418482d65c671dcb3c0f4462a": {
                "EndpointID": "fd3e7343f0f475297fa9ba459e3182cb941be33683c0c80843d11b9233ccf7c3",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:03",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.3/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        "Options": {}
    }
]
```

When we cat `/etc/hosts` (the hosts file) on `ubuntu1` we see the following contents:

```bash
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2.linux
```

and on `ubuntu2`:

```bash
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1.linux
```

Let's ping `ubuntu2.linux` from `ubuntu1` and ping `ubuntu1.linux` from `ubuntu2` using the `ping ubuntu1.linux` 
and `ping ubuntu2.linux` command. 

We have created the following:

![Two containers and one network](https://github.com/dnvriend/docker-networking-test/blob/master/yed/local-two-containers.png)

Now lets add a new container `ubuntu3` to the network `linux` and cat the hosts file:

```bash
$ docker run -it --net=linux --name=ubuntu3 ubuntu
$ cat /etc/hosts
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2.linux
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1.linux
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2
```

As you can see, the new container knows about the other ones, moreover, docker dynamically added the new container
to the hosts file of all other containers that are member of the network `linux`, and so when you cat the `/etc/hosts` 
file on the other containers, they also know about container `ubuntu3`. Let's ping `ubuntu3.linux` from `ubuntu1`. 

## Creating another network
Lets add another network `frontend` and launch an `ubuntu` container in that network:

```bash
$ docker network create frontend
$ docker run -it --net=frontend --name=ubuntu4 ubuntu
```

When you now inpect the network `linux` you only see 3 containers, that's because the fourth container is running in 
another network called `frontend`. When you cat the hosts file of container `ubuntu4`, you won't see the hosts from the 
`linux` network. You could try to ping `ubuntu4.frontend` but it won't work because the host is unknown. This is great, 
because we have complete isolation between the networks!

But say that we want to connect the `ubuntu4` container that is running in the `frontend` network to the `linux` network, 
how to we do that? Well, docker has the `docker network connect` command for that.  The purpose of the `connect` command 
is to connect a running `container` to another `network`, effectively making the container member of potentially multiple 
networks, let's try it:

```bash
$ docker network connect linux ubuntu4
```

When we now inspect the `linux` network with the command `docker network inspect linux`, we see that four containers are 
part of the `linux` network, and when we inspect the `frontend` network we see that only one container is part of the 
`frontend` network. Also note that the new container has been added to all hosts files of the containers that are member
of the `linux` network, so we can now ping the `ubuntu4.linux` host with the command `ping ubuntu4.linux` from eg. 
container `ubuntu1`, it works!

Note that we cannot do the following: `ping ubuntu4.frontend` because of a couple of reasons, the first and most obvious one, 
the hostname is not present in the hosts file of all containers that are member of the `linux` network, 
so that host name will be unknown. Secondly, the concept is that the `container` will be connected to a network, so `ubuntu4` 
is connected to `linux` and so the hostname is `ubuntu4.linux`. The `frontend` network is still fully isolated from any 
other networks, and that is what we want.

Lets add an `nginx` container to the `frontend` network:

```bash
$ docker run -itd --net=frontend --name=web nginx
```

When we inspect the `frontend` and `linux` networks, we see that we have `four` containers in the `linux` network and 
`two` containers in the `frontend` network. When we inspect the hosts file of container `ubuntu4` we see the following:

```
172.18.0.4	ubuntu3.linux
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1.linux
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2.linux
172.18.0.4	ubuntu3
172.19.0.3	web
172.19.0.3	web.frontend
```

The `ubuntu4` container can connect to all hosts because it is a member of both the `linux` and the `frontend` network. 

We have created the following:

![two-networks-single-host](https://github.com/dnvriend/docker-networking-test/blob/master/yed/two-networks-single-host.png)

# Single host networking with docker-compose
Can we translate the configuration above to a docker-compose? Well, not exactly. There are a couple of things we must take into account:

1. Read [Networking in Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/docs/networking.md)
2. Launch docker-compose with the `--x-networking` flag, because docker networking is still an experimental feature.
3. Compose sets up a single default network for your app. The name of the network defaults to the directory name the compose file exists in. 
   Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.
   The container name can be set with the `container_name` property if you don't want to use the default 
4. Compose uses the `bridge` driver when creating the appâ€™s network by default. The Docker Engine provides one other driver out-of-the-box: `overlay`, which implements secure communication 
   between containers on different hosts. Use the `--x-network-driver` flag to specify which driver to use. 
   
The example `single-host-networking.yml` shows how to launch three ubuntu containers, force compose to name them `ubuntu1` to `ubuntu3`.
When compose is started with the appropriate flags, a docker network will be created and *all* containers, without exception
will be made a member of the network that has the name of the project directory. Let's take a look at how to launch compose and 
how the hosts file looks like:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f single-host-networking.yml --x-networking up
# cat /etc/hosts 
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2.dockernetworkingtest
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1
172.18.0.2	ubuntu1.dockernetworkingtest
172.18.0.3	ubuntu2
```

Because the project directory is called `docker-networking-test` the network name will be normalized to `dockernetworkingtest`
and all containers will become a member of that network. This means that there is (still) no option to make containers members of 
another network, but for now this works.
